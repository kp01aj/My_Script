# My Script Bash.

This Repositories is recompilation of I created script bash.

# List Script.

- CLA - CHECK LINUX ATTACKED (CLA_Linux.sh).

   * Attackers who compromise a system take precautions while performing illegal activities and always
try to hide their movements. The attacker always installs some variant of backdoor on the compromised
system to maintain access.

   * Each incident leaves some evidence. If a team is compromised, it will definitely behave differently.
In this script some checks will be executed to generate a report that will help you know if your team
has been compromised.
